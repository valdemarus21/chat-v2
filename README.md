# chat-v2

one of my very first projects as a fullstack-dev.
The project uses : 
Client side : 
- react 
- react-router dom v6
- socket.io-client

Server part : 
- nodejs 
- cors 2.8 
- express
- nodemon
- socket.io 

To run an application : 
1) Clone the repository 
```
git clone https://github.com/valdemarus21/chat-v2.git
```
2) Install the client and server dependencies: 
```
cd server 
sudo npm i
cd client 
sudo npm i
```
After that you need to run client and server parts :
cd server 
sudo npm start dev
```
You will get a console message 'server ok' - the virtual server will start on your localhost 
Run the client part : 
```
cd client 
sudo npm start
```
After these manipulations a local server will be started on your computer, where you can go and see the project, it will be available at :
```
http://localhost:3000/
```
